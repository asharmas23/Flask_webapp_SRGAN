# Super-Resolution GAN Flask Web Application

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a practical application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image super-resolution, enhancing low-resolution images to high-resolution. The project utilizes Flask to create a web application, allowing users to upload images and receive enhanced versions. The GAN model employs advanced techniques, including hyper-parameter tuning, to achieve remarkable results in image quality enhancement.

## Features
- **Image Enhancement:** Transform low-resolution images into high-resolution using GANs.
- **Web Application:** A Flask-based interface for easy image uploading and processing.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Incorporation of hyper-parameter tuning and deep learning methodologies for optimal image enhancement.

## Technology Stack
- Python
- Flask
- GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
- HTML/CSS (for the web interface)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed on your system.

### Installation & Running
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asharmas23/Flask_webapp_SRGAN.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Flask_webapp_SRGAN
3. **To run the Flask application, open the flask.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment and execute the cells.**

### Usage
**Select Image:** Via the web interface, users can select a low-resolution image they wish to enhance.
**View Results:** The application processes the image and displays the enhanced super-resolution image alongside the original for comparison.
